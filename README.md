# Mixed Messages

## Description

This project was completed as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer skill path; it constitutes the first portfolio project on the skill path.

Each time main.js is run, it provides the user with some randomized insights and guidance drawn from my personal education in transformative coaching. Specifically, it provides the user with three pieces of "coaching:"
1. A quote.
2. A principle or concept to reflect on.
3. A suggested practice for the day.
The program has been set up such that the output is of a certain width, and some basic ASCII styling has been contributed to the suggested practice of the day.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding of fundamental JavaScript programming. In completing this project, I got to practice the following skills:
- Working with basic, foundational aspects of JavaScript like variables, functions, and console output.
- Array and string manipulation in JavaScript.
- Developing and running JavaScript code locally.
- Git version control (this was a key focus of this project).
- Working with the `date` JavaScript object (for the first time!).
The specific inspiration of making the theme of this project transformational coaching came from my own recent significant experiences with transformational coaching.

## Original Codecademy Prompt

"For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking."

### Project Objectives

- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Project Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## How to Use

To run this program one simply needs to run the main.js file.
