## Description

This is an extremely important component of the README. You should describe the main purpose of your project. Answer questions like “why did you build this project?” and “what problem(s) does it solve?”. It also helps to include your motivations for the project and what you learned from it.

## Features

If your project has multiple features, list them here. Don’t be afraid to brag if your project has unique features that make it stand out. You can even add screenshots and gifs to show off the features.

## How to Use

Here, you should write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use your project. Any software or package requirements should also be listed here.

## Technologies

List all the technologies and/or frameworks you used and what purpose they serve in your project.

## Collaborators

If others have contributed to your project in any way, it is important to give them credit for their work. Write your team members’ or collaborators’ names here along with a link to their GitHub profile.

## License

It’s also important to list a license on your README so other developers can understand what they can and cannot do with your project. You can use this guide to help you choose a license.

## Additional General Remarks from Codecademy

Your README file should be as good as your project itself.

Keep READMEs brief but detailed. README should always be up-to-date and self-explanatory. If you have spent a lot of time on your project, you should also spend a good chunk of time on the README. It can help your future self as well when you step away for a while and need to get reacquainted with your project. Not to mention it’ll leave a positive impression on future interviewers who look at your GitHub profile.

Documentation doesn’t have to be boring. Go for images or videos to make a project more understandable and appealing! We can add the project’s logo, diagrams, screenshots, or even GIFs! For Markdown files living in a repository, the path to the image can either be to an URL or to an image file in the repository. For example, if we had an image named `diagram.png` inside the `images` folder of the repository, we could reference it like so `![Use Case Diagram](./images/diagram.png)` in the README.md.
